                    <h5>Forest fires are caused by natural or man-made fires in tropical, temperate and boreal forests. A wildfire must have three conditions in order to burn: fuel, oxygen and a heat source. Any flammable item surrounding a fire, such as trees, grasses, bushes and even dwellings, is considered fuel. A fire requires oxygen to burn, which is provided by air. Heat sources aid in the ignition of the wildfire by raising the temperature of the fuel. Lightning, smoldering campfires or cigarettes, sweltering breezes and even the Sun can all ignite a wildfire. </h5>
