                    <h5>An earthquake is a sudden and rapid shaking of the ground caused by the shifting of rocks beneath the earth’s surface, or by volcanic or magmatic activity in the earth. Earthquakes strike suddenly, without warning, and can occur at any time. They can lead to death, injuries, property damage, loss of shelter and livelihoods and disruption of critical infrastructure. Most deaths are due to buildings collapsing or to secondary hazards, such as fires, tsunamis, flooding, landslides and release of chemicals or toxic materials. </h5>

                <li>If you're indoors, stand against a wall near the center of the building, stand in a doorway, or crawl under heavy furniture (a desk or table). Stay away from windows and outside doors.</li><br>
                <li>If you're outdoors, stay in the open away from power lines or anything that might fall. Stay away from buildings (stuff might fall off the building or the building could fall on you).</li><br>
                <li>Don't use matches, candles, or any flame.</li><br>
                <li>If you're in a car, stop the car and stay inside the car until the earthquake stops.</li><br>

                <li>Stay away from beaches. Tsunamis and seiches sometimes hit after the ground has stopped shaking.</li><br>
                <li>Turn on the radio and listen for emergency broadcasts/announcements, news reports, and instructions. Cooperate with public safety officials.</li><br>
